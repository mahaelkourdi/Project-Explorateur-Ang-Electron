Absolutely minimal version of GSIV to work with touch screens and very slow processors.

To view the demo: [http://craigfrancis.github.com/zoomify/](http://craigfrancis.github.com/zoomify/)

This code is not intended to be a final solution that you include in your project, it is intended to create a basic version that you need to read though, understand and customise to your particular needs.

To use as a sub-module:

	git submodule add https://github.com/craigfrancis/zoomify.git ./path

You may want to look at:

	PanoJS
		http://www.dimin.net/software/panojs/
		http://code.google.com/p/panojs/
		Works on iPhone, but slow on mobile phones with large images.

	GSIV
		http://www.mojavelinux.com/projects/panojs/
		Where PanoJS came from, but does not support touch events.

	Zoomify
		http://www.zoomify.com/
		Original idea came from, but also has issues (and not open source).

	ShiftZoom
		http://www.netzgesta.de/shiftzoom/
		Couldn't get the demos to work myself on a mobile phone.

	jQuery UI
		http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/
		Fairly basic draggable support (not complete solution - and adds too much).
